# Node.js Scraping Service

This Node.js application provides an API endpoint to run 2 scraping scripts. The first will scrape the first 100 articles from Hacker News and validates that the articles are sorted from newest to oldest. The second will scrape titles and urls of the first 10 articles. The service returns a validation confirmation and the 10 articles.

The server uses Express.js and Playwright for scraping. It features error handling, logging, and CORS configuration to control access.

The service is running off a Docker image and is deployed on Render.
