# Scrape with Playwright

This is a simple React application using TypeScript and Vite. The page includes a button that, when clicked, sends an HTTP POST request to a remote server. The server will run two scraping scripts and, upon a successful response, the app displays the first ten articles from YCombinator. Additionally, it shows a message validating the correct order of the first 100 YCombinator articles.

The project is using Vitest for basic testing of the application.
